This is a python program used to predict the electronic coupling between two molecules. The usage is simple:

python3 NapDimerPredictionfromQCheminput.py QCheminput.inp

Note: QCheminput.inp should be written in the input format of Q-Chem. However, the prediction itself does not require the Q-Chem program
